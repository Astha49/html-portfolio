<h1>The best movies according to Astha</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Tearsmith</h3>
<p>This movie's emotions and music feels straight to the heart. I can hear it as a bedtime story my whole life. All time favorite.</p>

<h3>The fault in our stars</h3>
<p> I don't know it just stays stuck in my head.</p>

<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p> Still understanding what I like about this movie. I think its the name that facinates.</p>
